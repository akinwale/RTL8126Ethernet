# RTL8126Ethernet

A macOS driver for Realtek RTL8126 5GBit Ethernet Controllers adapted from [LucyRTL8125Ethernet](https://github.com/Mieze/LucyRTL8125Ethernet) with source code from [rtl8126](https://github.com/openwrt/rtl8126).

### Note: This is a work in progress and the driver does NOT work at the moment. Loading a built .kext will result in a system crash. Use at your own risk.
